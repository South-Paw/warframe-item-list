## Why?

Because I couldn't find a near complete list of all Warframe items that contributed specifically to player mastery rank... so I originally spent 2 evenings cataloguing the [Warframe Wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons) item mastery lists and making some objects up that would be easy to reuse in a Javascript app.

A fair few commits later, this project uses an updater script which fetches the latest content from the `http://content.warframe.com/MobileExport` endpoints and transforms it into this mastery rank list. This is the same endpoints/urls that the [Warframe Mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalextremes.warframenexus) uses to get the current game data - so assuming the endpoints/urls are left as-is, this repo will remain reasonably up to date.

Please note that the endpoints are NOT publicly documented by Digital Extremes (so they could disappear or change at any time) and they do not provide information such a weapon categories. Because of this, we maintain the categories manually in this repo and there may be mistakes and/or inaccuracies with our data or the endpoint/urls.

If you come across any missing items, problems or mistakes - please let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/issues/new) or even [fixing it yourself](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/pulls) with a pull-request. See contributing section for more info.

## Install

`yarn add warframe-item-list`

or

`npm i warframe-item-list`

## Usage

```js
const { version, array, objects, constants } = require('warframe-item-list');

console.log(version);   // returns the warframe game version of the item list.
console.log(array);     // returns a big list of every item object.
console.log(objects);   // returns an object keyed by type, these contain lists of item objects.
console.log(constants); // returns the constants used to define item attributes.
```

## Objects

If you `console.log` the root object, you'll get the following:

```js
{
  version: 'string',
  array: [...],
  objects: {
    Amp: [...],
    Archwing: [...],
    ArchwingMelee: [...],
    ArchwingPrimary: [...],
    Kavat: [...],
    Kubrow: [...],
    Melee: [...],
    Primary: [...],
    Secondary: [...],
    Sentinel: [...],
    SentinelWeapon: [...],
    Warframe: [...],
    Zaw: [...],
  },
  constants: {
    TYPE: {...},
    TYPES: {...},
    MELEE_CATEGORIES: {...},
    PRIMARY_CATEGORIES: {...},
    SECONDARY_CATEGORIES: {...},
  },
};
```

Within each list, the objects are pretty similarly structured:

```js
{
  id: 'string',          // unique id for the item.
  name: 'string',        // name of the item.
  type: 'string',        // type the item belongs to.
  category: 'string',    // category of the weapon - this is only used on primary/secondary/melee and sentinel weapons.
  masteryRank: 0,        // mastery rank required for the item.
  image: 'string',       // TODO: unimplemented at the moment.
  wiki: 'string',        // url for the items warframe wiki page.
},
```

And the `constants` contains the strings that are used to define the `category` and `type` keys in the item objects.

There is also a handy `types` exposed in the `constants` where by using a `type` key you can get it's pural.

```js
const { TYPE, TYPES } = require('warframe-item-list').constants;

console.log(TYPE.PRIMARY);        // returns string 'primary'.
console.log(TYPES[TYPE.PRIMARY]); // returns string 'primaries'.
```
