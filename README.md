## Why?

Because I couldn't find a near complete list of all Warframe items that contributed to mastery rank... so I spent 2 evenings cataloguing the [Warframe Wiki](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons) item mastery lists and making some objects up that would be easy to reuse in a Javascript app.

Since there isn't an official public API or anything to get this information, this project is managed manually with the help of the Warframe wiki. This of course means that it may also contain mistakes and/or inaccuracies on items.

If you come across any missing items, problems or mistakes - please let me know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/issues/new) or even [fixing it yourself](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/pulls) with a pull-request. See contributing section for more info.

## Install

`npm i warframe-item-list`

## Usage

```js
const { array, objects, constants } = require('warframe-item-list');

console.log(array);     // returns a big list of every item.
console.log(objects);   // returns an object containing named lists and objects for more specific uses.
console.log(constants); // returns the same lists used to define the `acquisition`, `category` and `type` keys.
```

## Objects

If you `console.log` the root object, you'll get the following:

```js
{
  version: 'string',
  array: [...],
  objects: {
    AMPS: [...],
    ARCHWINGS: [...],
    ARCHWING_GUNS: [...],
    ARCHWING_MELEES: [...],
    COMPANION_SENTINELS: [...],
    COMPANION_KUBROWS: [...],
    COMPANION_KAVATS: [...],
    SENTINEL_WEAPONS: [...],
    WARFRAMES: [...],
    WEAPON_PRIMARIES: [...],
    WEAPON_SECONDARIES: [...],
    WEAPON_MELEES: [...],
    ZAWS: [...],
  },
  constants: {
    acquisitions: {...},
    acquisitionQuests: {...},
    acquisitionFactions: {...},
    acquisitionEnemies: {...},
    primaryCategories: {...},
    secondaryCategories: {...},
    meleeCategories: {...},
    itemTypes: {...},
  },
};
```

Within each list, the objects are pretty similarly structured:

```js
{
  name: 'string',        // name of the item (required).
  acquisition: 'string', // where to acquire the item (required).
  category: 'string',    // category of weapon - this is only used for primary/secondary/melee weapons.
  masteryRank: 0,        // the mastery rank required to craft (required).
  type: 'string',        // if the using the array export, items will have a type attached as well.
},
```

And the `constants` provided are the same that are used to define the `acquisition`, `type` and `group` in the item objects.

## Contributing

Again, if you come across any missing items, problems or mistakes - please let me know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/issues/new) or feel free to have a shot at [fixing it yourself](https://github.com/South-Paw/warframe-item-list/pulls) with a pull-request.

Please ensure that any PRs are linted and keep with the general flow of things.

* Items should be grouped by `category` (categories follow the wiki order)
* Items are alphabetically sorted by `name` within each `category`
